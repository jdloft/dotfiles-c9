# dotfiles-c9
Its redundant, I know.

## Install
HTTPS
```
git clone https://github.com/jdloft/dotfiles-c9.git ~/.dotfiles-c9 && ~/.dotfiles-c9/dotfiles-c9.sh
```
SSH
```
git clone git@github.com:jdloft/dotfiles-c9.git ~/.dotfiles-c9 && ~/.dotfiles-c9/dotfiles-c9.sh
```

## Notes
This was setup because I don't need everything that is in my regular dotfiles repo in C9
and the dotfiles script I'm using isn't compatible with some things in C9.
